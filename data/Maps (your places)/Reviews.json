We tried regular katlambe ( it's like a deep fried kachori but without any stuffing), extra crispy katlambe with gravy chole and dry chole with buttermilk. The stall is hygienic and there were a lot of local people coming here for parcel. A must visit for anyone coming to Dehradun and seeking this type of breakfast. In early mornings, the stall is accessible by car but later it gets crowded as it is near subzi Mandi area.  We never had tried katlambe before and liked it very much. Will be definitely pinning this place for our future visits.  The stall itself has been there for 50+ years. One person eating there mentioned he has been eating here for 30+ years now! Again, huge shoutout to the warmth and the hospitality with which Mamaji serves food. 5/5 highly recommended."

The beach itself isn't very crowded and is very relaxing and on the cleaner side ( very less thrash comparatively).The sound of the waves crashing on the beach is heard throughout the night and is very peaceful. Lots of non vegetarian food options. Veg options are limited but tasty. Domes are equipped with ACs which work well. Bathrooms and beddings are maintained super clean. A very good stay experience located north of main Gokarna beach. Very peaceful, relaxing getaway. Hidden gem. Far better than many other gokarna properties and  value for money. 5/5 recommended."

We shifted to a table with less loud noise (apple watch also alerted that the surroundings are loud) and the menu is only through QR code and no physical menu. No one came to table to even bring water. They had internet glitches and weren't able to deliver our order. No one ensured even our original order was delivered properly or not. Good served was cold. Waiters looked uninterested and frustrated. Overall, do not plan to go without calling and ensuring the place is properly opened. Maybe wait a couple of weeks. Oh and we had to use our hands as a fan to stop flies from sitting on our food. Quality of service and experience not worth the price at all.

They ensure proper and timely communication before the trip starts and mantain it until after the trip ends. Top notch hospitality and every person from ecosphere super polite. There are two very unique aspects of the experience and what makes them different from any other tour operator. Firstly, the guide who accompanies for most of the trip is a local person from Spiti valley. This is a good contrast from other operators because with a local guide, you get to learn about culture, practices, and get any other question answered which an outsider wouldn't know. Secondly, a authentic true-to-roots village homestay in Demul, which is a part of their itinerary is a very unique and a rewarding experience. I felt Demul is also probably the best place in Spiti tour to watch a crystal clear night sky(if weather permits). Ecosphere also have a not-for-profit wing, so do ensure you talk to them about it as well. Highly recommended. A must-have experience of a lifetime."

Must try bajra roti and kadhi khichdi. The folks who run that place are very homely and nice. Macha Cot and table chair both seating options are available. There are some rustic touches with a couple of Desi swings hanging from trees nearby. There's also a machaan, an elevated platform 6-7feet above a tree which one can climb with a ladder. Overall, it was a very memorable experience for us. Finding such places anywhere is rare. 5/5 highly recommend."

We had ordered paneer tikka and paneer kadhai thalis with laccha parantha. Technically this means that in an empty restaurant it took 20mins to make 4 laccha paranthas. There are way too many people in serving/waiting (almost 1 person per table) and feels like not enough people in the kitchen actually cooking maybe. Taste of combos was ok, like any mall food court outlet. Nothing I would like to come again for.\n\nSeating space is neat and designed well. But the place falls short in organized and fast service. We didn't order chaats but it looked like chaat was being served promptly. In hindsight, we should have stuck to ordering only chaats and chole bhature and not the combos."

Food was good (some items were bad like moong dal halwa) but that doesn't compensate for the poor, neglected quality of the room. The place seems to have taken a hit like many other hotels during covid and there seems to be negligence in mantainence. Even the pepper creepers were infested with mealybugs in the property. Tea took ages to get delivered in room. The game room was neatly mantained and good. There's a paid airhockey table as well which is good. The place has two entrances, so ensure you drop your luggage at lower entrance only as from upper entrance you'd have to get it yourself for 2-3 floors.\nOverall, after this borderline torture experience of not having slept properly through the night due to mold in the room, Sterling group goes into my blacklist for some time. Their objective seems to be providing sub-quality rooms to make up for the losses they have had."

The property manager went with us in our own car and we went to a lake and a viewpoint. Along with a museum, the entire tour took approx 1h30mins. The place is very neatly mantained, and the staff is friendly and they answer any and all questions related to coffee. However, 500per head is too expensive and not worth the experience, if you've already been to and stayed in good coffee estates in other places like Coorg, Chikmaglur or Wayanad. You get to experience the same thing for free there along with the stay. So if you have been to a plantation before anytime, this place could be skipped.\nPS: For a 500rs charge, the least the property owner could do is provide a sample of free coffee to taste. Maybe put that in thermos and serve it near the lake. Right now, with our own car going in muddy roads, with nothing complimentary at all, I don't think that price point has much to offer to visitors.\n\nWe didn't do the horse riding experience, and I believe that could be interesting, but they don't allow to get off the horse near the lake for entire duration of the 30min tour costing 1700pp. Having been to the lake, i can say that I personally wouldn't have enjoyed that tour at that price as well."

If one doesn't get the chance to take the forest safari, they can also opt for a Jeep ride through the nearby jungle road. While it doesn't take you offroad like official safari rides, animals like  elephant, deers etc are easily spotted. The evening Jeep ride is a good option to consider if one doesn't get to take the official safari during their trip. But if someone has already visited the jungle through safari, then this option could be skipped. The property is very close to kuruvadweep, which is a major tourist attraction.\n\nNow to the bad part. Rooms are also neatly mantained, beds are comfortable and the views are ok (not amazing) but the jacuzzi room is a complete waste of money. 1/5 rating for the room. Jacuzzi tub is placed in a very dingy location, where dirty water drips from the top. Zero privacy thanks to wooden walls and the placement of the tub makes one claustrophobic. It's dingy and looks cheap. The washroom and the interiors however were perfect and well built. So anyone reading the review so far, I'd recommended not wasting any money on jacuzzi room, but normal rooms are pretty good, location is amazing and staff is courteous. The pool is ok. One can go to a peaceful walk to the nearby Kabini river as well.\n\nThere is also slight negligence regarding mask wearing. Good majority of people in management wear them properly but some don't."

There is a bit of mantainence needed for the interiors and washrooms, but overall it was a 5/5 experience for us. The staff is very friendly and the food is delicious.\n\nThe entrance to the property is via a 300-400m paved road through a farm and as expected, it is far off from any noise pollution. There are limited rooms on the property, which is a very good thing. Interior furnitures are mantained in good condition and beds are comfortable.\n\nDo ask the management there for activities nearby and go for a short morning walk/trek and evening lepoard safari. Both the experiences would be one of a kind and totally worth the buck.\n\nI would personally have loved to have a relaxing hot shower but the fixtures weren't mantained enough, and the rooms could need a little more furniture, maybe a table and two chairs at least to keep stuff and hang stuff somewhere. I am not complaining given the price point of the rooms, but even at a slightly higher price, I would have liked to have these basic necessities fulfilled.\n\nI'll recommend the place for isolation, experience and friendliness of the staff and management. Comfort in rooms is a compromise to be honest, but still worth the overall experience. Will be visiting again sometime.",

The goosebumps we got when driving in the gypsy car on the stone hills is also a one of a kind, and a must-try lifetime experience.\nAlthough finding/spotting wildlife is always hit and miss situation, but Shahrukh took all the efforts one could, in an attempt to spot cheetah. The binoculars provided during safari were also in good condition and were of professional quality.\nNote that this is not the forest area safari. It happens in the surrounding villages instead. Although personally a bit skeptical at first, I now believe that this experience adds more to what a forest safari can offer, as it takes you through isolated places as well as some rural villages, giving a glimpse of local culture as well. Highly recommended.\nIn my opinion, bothforest Safari and Shahrukh's safari (not any other)  should be tried to have a complete and rich experience."

You aren't amazon and your customer support can only dream to be as good as them.\nWhat I've faced so far:\n- Radio silence on a complaint for which I sent the pics over whatsapp to an employee\n- Someone calling me and saying they'll call back in 10mins & literally vanishing\n- Unhelpful telephonic exchange with the store\n- More than 24hrs after the broken item delivered, and still no ETA on having a working item delivered.\n- On top of that, the executive was suggesting to buy 4 year warranty from ResQ. I say, if you're reading this, resque yourself from such service.\n\nInsanely bad experience for a repeat customer(from 5 stars 2 years ago). The entire store management seems beaurucratic and only interest is to sell products and sell warranties, and fail to deliver when it comes to service."

We were quite inquisitive about the food and thanks to him we got to taste a lot of regional food and drinks. The cottage is built with some serious thought into it and mantained perfectly. Having a private pool doesn't hurt as well. :) The place is at a walkable\ndistance from the bus drop point(coming from Bangalore) over a hill.\n\nBut more than the food and the amazing stay, it was the hospitality and welcoming nature of Rajeev and his family which makes the stay worth remembering.\n\nPS: Do ask to see his private antiquity collection upstairs. It's like a small private museum and a short tour in itself."

We ordered chai(tea) after dinner(rajma masala, dal makhni and paranthas) and it was equally good . They also had complimentary papad as a pre-starter and a onion salad( can't get any more Indian than that!).\n\nOverall the place has a pretty warm and friendly feeling to it both because of the amazingly prepared food as well as the people serving it. I cannot emphasize this enough, if this restaurant had opened in my city, it would definitely have been my go-to place. A definite must visit to satisfy craving for Indian food."

For skybridge, it's a separate ticket to be purchased at 5RM for a nature walk. The nature walk, skybridge and cable car are the best and the only areas one should visit(5 star review). Skyrex 4d had the worst 3D goggles I have experienced in any theatre ever, and all of us were seeing 2 shifted images instead of one 3d image.(1 star review). I would recommend not wasting time on any attractions present at the ground level and go only for cable car and skybridge. Even though their pricing is such that you'd have to pay anyways, but it's not worth spending time on them."

Will definitely visit again, hoping that things have changed since my last visit.\nMy experience:\nThe place is beautifully maintained but that does NOT matter. Indians are not allowed in the place. The guard outside lied to me and made an excuse that some construction work is going on and the garden is closed. After some time I saw some foreigners going in. This discrimination is not spiritual and definitely not wise ( Guard even tried to stop an Indian origin couple from UK ). It took some confrontation from their part before he let us in. Im appalled to see a place like this in India. Even though after a discussion, I was allowed inside but by that time I had completely lost the interest and the feeling of simply sitting quietly there and enjoying the view. Owner should put a banner that it's a private property or that explicitly foreign passport holders are allowed, instead of branding as a tourist attraction( I came through Google maps). Anyone against this discrimination shouldn't be going there."
